      As i started on my journey down a career path I originally started down the medical field, I wanted to be a physical therapist. Though, as enjoying as it was to be useful and needed it was not my true passion, I was intruged with the money of it. As time passed I kept getting little clues from God that I was in the wrong degree field and that it was time to change to something I was more passionate about. After taking a year off from college and focusing on my son I started a search for what degree program would best suite me and my restrictions with on campus schooling. I found stAte and knew that a web designer is what I was meant to pursue. Although at times it can be overwhelming and difficult I have found that there are many ways to achieve seemingly impossible tasks. In the future I aim to help others along their journey of becoming and web designer or coder. I want to build a website that allows inneractivity and Q&A groups about web design and code, I want to clean up the world one web design at a time.
